	<p>Stanley worked for a company in a big building where he was Employee #427. Employee #427's job was simple: he sat at his desk in Room 427 and he pushed buttons on a keyboard.</p>
	<p>Employee #427's job was simple: he sat at his desk in Room 427 and he pushed buttons on a keyboard.</p>
	<p>Orders came to him through a monitor on his desk telling him what buttons to push, how long to push them, and in what order.</p>
	<p>This is what Employee #427 did every day of every month of every year, and although others may have considered it soul rending,</p>
	<p>Stanley relished every moment that the orders came in, as though he had been made exactly for this job.</p>
	<p>And Stanley was happy.</p>
	<p>And then one day, something very peculiar happened.</p>
	<p>Something that would forever change Stanley;</p>
	<p>Something he would never quite forget.</p>
	<p>He had been at his desk for nearly an hour when he had realized not one single order had arrived on the monitor for him to follow.</p>
	<p>No one had shown up to give him instructions, call a meeting, or even say 'hi'. Never in all his years at the company had this happened, this complete isolation.</p>
	<p>Something was very clearly wrong. Shocked, frozen solid, Stanley found himself unable to move for the longest time.</p>
	<p>But as he came to his wits and regained his senses, he got up from his desk and stepped out of his office.</p>
	<p></p>

	<p>But Stanley simply couldn't handle the pressure.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>What if he had to make a decision? What if a crucial outcome fell under his responsibility? He had never been trained for that! No, this couldn't go any way except badly.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>The thing to do now, Stanley thought to himself, is to wait. Nothing will hurt me. Nothing will break me. In here, I can be happy, forever. I will be happy.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>Stanley waited. Hours passed. Then days. Had years gone by? He no longer had the ability to tell.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>But the one thing he knew, for sure, beyond any doubt, was that if he waited long enough, the answers would come. Eventually, some day, they would arrive. Soon,</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>Very soon now, this will end. He will be spoken to. He will be told what to do. Now it's just a little bit closer. Now it's even closer. Here it comes..</p>

	<p>Ah, I can see you've found the Out of the Map ending! Well done. You see, in the original game, you can abuse chair hitboxes to break out of the map, where there would be an ending waiting for you.</p>
	<p>However, that doesn't translate too well to the text-based nature of this port, so here you go, a new ending! I've made a few more changes here and there to certain elements of the game to make the transition to text go smoother.</p>
	<p>While you're here, i'd like to recommend The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe, the remake of the gamme this is based off. It adds a lot of new content to the original game, none of which will be included in this text port.</p>

	<p>And then perhaps the strangest question of them all entered Stanley's head, one he was amazed he hadn't asked himself sooner:</p>
	<p>Why is there a voice in my head, dictating everything that I'm doing and thinking?</p>
	<p>Now the voice was describing itself being considered by Stanley, who found it particularly strange. I'm dreaming about a voice describing me thinking about how it's describing my thoughts, he thought!</p>

<div class="divsect" id="madness-7">
	<p style="color: #008000">You step into a waiting room. There are a few chairs, as well as a filling cabinet with 4 clocks on it.</p>
	<p>And while he thought it all very odd and wondered if this voice spoke to all people in their dreams, the truth was that of course this was not a dream. How could it be?</p>
	<p>Was Stanley simply deceiving himself? Believing that if he's asleep he doesn't have to take responsibility for himself?</p>

	<a href="#madness-8">> Stanley is as awake right now as he's ever been in his life.</a>
</div>

<div class="divsect" id="madness-8">
	<p>Now hearing the voice speak these words was quite a shock to Stanley. After all, he knew for certain beyond a doubt that this was, in fact, a dream!</p>
	<p>Did the voice not see him float and make the magical stars just a moment ago? How else would the voice explain all that?</p>
	<p>This voice was a part of himself too, surely, surely if he could just...</p>
	<p>He would prove it. He would prove that he was in control, that this was a dream.</p>

	<a href="#madness-9">> Close your eyes.</a>
</div>

<div class="divsect" id="madness-9">
	<p>So he closed his eyes gently, and he invited himself to wake up.</p>
	<p>He felt the cool weight of the blanket on his skin, the press of the mattress on his back, the fresh air of a world outside this one. Let me wake up, he thought to himself.</p>
	<p>I'm through with this dream, I wish it to be over. Let me go back to my job, let me continue pushing the buttons, please, it's all I want.</p>
	<p>I want my apartment, and my wife, and my job. All I want is my life exactly the way it's always been.</p>
	<p>My life is normal, I am normal. Everything will be fine.</p>
	<p>I am okay.</p>
